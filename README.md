## Built With

This section is intended to list the frameworks and tools you're using to develop this software. Please link to the home page or documentatation in each case.

[Python](https://www.python.org/)  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Any tools or versions of languages needed to run code. For example specific Python or Node versions. Minimum hardware requirements also go here.

You only need Python 3 to use this module

### Installation

How to build or install the applcation.

No installation required. Just place the module directory in your PYTHONPATH.

### Running Locally

How to run the application on your local system.

Import the module into your python file or project:

import sequence

### Running Tests

How to run tests on your local system.

Not required.

## Deployment

### Local

Deploying to a production style setup but on the local system. Examples of this would include `venv`, `anaconda`, `Docker` or `minikube`. 

### Production

Deploying to the production system. Examples of this would include cloud, HPC or virtual machine. 

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial Research  
- [ ] Minimum viable product <-- You are Here  
- [ ] Alpha Release  
- [ ] Feature-Complete Release  

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
